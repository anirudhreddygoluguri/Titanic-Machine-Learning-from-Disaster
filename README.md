# Titanic_Machine_Learning_from_Disaster

This is a famous problem in the Kaggle challenges. In this challenge, I have done the complete analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. I have applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. In this I have done the preprocessing but converting the categorical variables into the numericals by using the Label encoding technique and the dummies creation techniques to deal with the categorical variables and for the missing values I have used the most correlated features and filled the missing values using the fillna technique with lambda function and the median, mean values whichever seems to be best suited at that point.
For Prediction I have used Random Forest, Support Vector and Gradient boosting technique and using the Voting classifier at the end.
I have plotted the learning curves to seem how the training and cross validation are present
